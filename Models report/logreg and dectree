âœ… 1. Logistic Regression
Model Type: Binary Classification
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Training-Test Split: 70% Train / 30% Test
Data Scaling: StandardScaler

ðŸ“Œ Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: ~0.84

Precision: ~0.71

Recall: ~0.53

F1 Score: ~0.61

ROC AUC Score: 0.76

ðŸ“Œ Interpretation:
The model performs well in distinguishing attrition cases with a decent balance between false positives and false negatives.

ROC AUC score of 0.76 indicates the model can differentiate between employees who will stay and those who may leave with good reliability.



âœ… 2. Decision Tree Classifier
Model Type: Binary Classification
Algorithm: Decision Tree (max_depth=5, Gini criterion)
Training-Test Split: 70% Train / 30% Test
Data Scaling: Not required

ðŸ“Œ Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: ~0.86

Precision: ~0.75

Recall: ~0.56

F1 Score: ~0.64

ROC AUC Score: 0.79

ðŸ“Œ Interpretation:
The Decision Tree slightly outperforms Logistic Regression in accuracy and AUC.

It also offers better interpretability with rule-based classification and enables SHAP analysis for feature explanation.

This model is well-suited for HR teams to understand and act on attrition patterns.
